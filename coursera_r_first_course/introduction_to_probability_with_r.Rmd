hi this is debrupa nandi
**today is my second day with git**



# studies
**observational - **
1. collect data in a way that does not directly interfere with how the data arise("observe")
2. only establish an association
3. retrospective uses past data
4. prospective - data are collected throughout the study

**experiment**- randomly assign subjects to treatments

Confounding variables - extraneous variables that affect both the explanatory and the response variable and that make it seem like there is a relationship between them

**Correlation does not imply causation**
**Observational staements help make us make correlation statements**
**Experiments help us infer causation**

#### In statistics, a confounder is a variable that influences both the dependent variable and independent variable, causing a spurious association. Confounding is a causal concept, and as such, cannot be described in terms of correlations or associations. ####
